As the barrier between public and private sectors crumbles, what is business role in the classroom?

In "What Is Business's Social Compact?" (January-February 1994), Bernard Avishai examines the nature of business's social responsibility in a competitive environment that has superseded Adam Smith's division of labor. The nature of work has undergone, and continues to undergo, a fundamental transformation. Today's managers feel that a once clear separation between public and private sectors has broken down. More specifically, they are spending heavily on education and training and wondering if doing so is their responsibility.

Does business have an obligation not only to train its current employees but also to educate the workforce of the future? What form should business's involvement in education take? According to Avishai, today's learning organizations must be teaching organizations too. Managers must recognize their obligation to support such efforts and, given the revolutionary potential of the new information network, exploit their ability to profit from them.

Nine experts examine the role of business in education. Avishai then offers a brief response.

To suggest, as Bernard Avishai does, that business recognize its "collective stake" in helping create the "architecture of new educational institutions" underscores the new dynamic of business, education, and government increasingly finding ways to forge a common language and sense of purpose when it comes to education reform.

Indeed, education reform can only happen if it is comprehensive, creating new partnerships at every level: from early-childhood-development and school-to-work programs to after-school and summer programs. Business leadership has been central, along with the nation's governors, to the growing support for new, higher standards, which are embodied in the Goals 2000: Educate America Act.

Business has to act as a counterbalancing force and help create the framework for real consensus building around a new set of assumptions that recognize the impact of technology and the very great need to rethink how we teach and learn, regardless of which school a child attends. And if that task isn't difficult enough, the process of education reform is becoming still more complicated by the changing demographics of our school-age population. An older generation of taxpayers who have raised their children and, to their minds, paid their dues must now be persuaded that it is the business of the nation to educate a more racially mixed school-age population, including millions of new immigrants.

The Clinton administration, with strong business support, is working hard to promote new school-to-work legislation to help propel the majority of high school graduates into the workplace. We can no longer use high schools to sort young people into one track that leads to college and another that leads nowhere in particular. We know that the majority of high school graduates -- around 75% -- either will not attend or will not finish four years of college. This is our future workforce. Business should be fully involved and engaged in the process of implementing school-to-work programs at the local level.

Just as we need to rethink how we educate our children and reinvent our high schools, business will have to reformulate long-held assumptions about the place of work and even about the time when work is done. The necessity of new thinking is becoming increasingly evident given the capacity of new information technologies. For example, my colleague Attorney General Janet Reno makes the case that the best way to stop crime and help children is to change the workday. Adults should finish work by the time their children finish school.

Surely, we need to inject good business sense into the process of reforming education. After all, you can't spend tax dollars or continue to do what you have been doing without asking, in the end, whether or not it works. However, the privatization of education in order to achieve quality and performance will have to meet some basic criteria that may not lend themselves to a high profit margin: curricula that meet world-class standards, the education of all children including the disadvantaged and the disabled, and accountability to the public. Sorting out the cost and the profit of this effort has yet to be done.

President Clinton and I, with the help of business and education leaders across the United States, intend to generate and sustain a climate of intense creativity and activity in order to produce a literate workforce for the future.

By 1900, the rudimentary training for which public schools had originally been established had already been undermined by educators and schools that were acting as if their mission were the true liberal education of the masses. A decade later, however, the pendulum had swung the other way.

In 1913, William H. Maxwell, New York City's school superintendent, reacted angrily to growing demands by the business community, under pressure from German competition, for the introduction of vocational education. He spoke of the "arrogant unreasonableness" of educational theorists who "denounced the public schools ... because they are not training artisans." Nevertheless, schools changed. Vocational education flourished, and schools began to turn out factory workers and clerks.

Then -- like today -- tens of thousands of non-English-speaking, culturally diverse, immigrant children from the poorest socioeconomic groups flooded the schools. Under the pressure of this increased population, the factory-model school was born. It survives to this day and is the reviled object of educational reformers, philosophers, and businesspeople alike. All of us want to end top-down, bureaucratic management, standardized testing as the only measurement of productivity, the teacher as lecturer, and inflexible union rules.

We want the new way of doing business introduced to our schools. In education, we're calling this site-based management and shared decision making. We're struggling to introduce technology and computer-assisted instruction; interactive, interdisciplinary curricula; performance measures, incentives, and standards.

A few educators disagree. They are rallying for a back-to-basics approach. Others are overwhelmed by the demands that the new socialization puts on us: How do we maintain the civil society that business needs in order to function? What curriculum changes can we make to prevent kids from killing one another? What conflict resolution and peer mediation programs? What family living and socialization texts should we use? What school restructuring? And what is the role of business in all this?

Education always requires complex answers. However, there are a few specific, fairly simple ideas for business to follow: keep people employed; support higher salaries for urban teachers; improve the education of prospective teachers; direct the bulk of available resources into classrooms; support the continuous education of working teachers; help recruit the best possible school principals; and, finally, learn from the schools that have successfully combined vocational-technical education with academics.

As James Brian Quinn points out, employees of tomorrow will need to know customers and understand software, machines, protocols, and telecom equipment. But they'll still need schools to teach them the qualities that Avishai summarizes so well: the capacity for grace under pressure, abstract thinking, cogent speech, and problem solving.

Do I think that the private sector should be involved in education? Wrong question. The only question is how.

Because of business's extraordinary financial and political resources, the strong tradition of corporate philanthropy in the United States, and the central importance of the public school system to the lives of young Americans, business should assume a role in public education. For the Panasonic Foundation, however, the issue is not whether or not business needs a workforce that is educated in a different way than it was in the past. Rather, the issue is one of equity: who has access to the good schools? Certainly, disadvantaged children have the same rights as advantaged children to the best education that the system has to offer.

The Panasonic Foundation's Partnership Program works with urban school districts that serve large concentrations of disadvantaged youth. The program shares with many current reform efforts the belief that decisions affecting children's learning should be made whenever possible by those closest to the children. In addition, the program aims at restructuring whole schools, not just isolated aspects, so that no child falls through the cracks.

Unlike many other reform efforts, however, the Partnership Program is as much focused on the redesign of an entire school system -- be it a school district or state department of education. After all, only when policies governing schools are changed, and districts and education departments transform themselves from bureaucracies that control and impede into systems that actively nurture and facilitate school-level reform, will good schools become the rule rather than the exception.

This kind of change takes time, money, and ideas and information about how to change -- not to mention help with the change process itself. With that in mind, the Partnership Program provides direct technical assistance, rather than grants, to its partner systems and the schools in them in order to increase the capacity of adults in the system to conceive, plan, and implement their own improvement efforts. And the program commits the Panasonic Foundation to a long-term, five-to-ten year partnership with school systems -- a long enough period, one hopes, to institutionalize the culture of ongoing reform at every level of the system.

Bernard Avishai's diagnoses of U.S. education are as valid as his prescriptions are naive. Although he grasps the troubles in our cities, the poor performance of our students, and the need for modernization, Avishai ignores three critical conditions confounding the innovations that he prefers.

First, he overlooks the social context of schooling. The breakup of family and the breakdown of community, together, adversely affect the ability of children to learn. Second, public schools -- fractured, overly specialized, and "loosely coupled" institutions -- are not structured for easy reform. Try introducing a new computerized mathematics program into a system where teachers work in isolated classrooms, away from other colleagues, and have little or no time to share with and support one another. And third, public education is a public monopoly and thus has hardly any incentive to innovate at all. Public education was until recently insulated from pressures to compete, change, and improve. Avishai and other reformers should consider many kinds of schools: public (magnet schools of choice), private, and parochial.

Because he ignores these conditions, Avishai falls into three traps:

The problem is moral, not technical. For 75 years, critics of schools have concentrated on the technical side of the problem, for example, the use of space, time, and technology. In fact, the failure of urban schools mostly results from a breakdown of the moral order, including family, community, church, and school. When 65% of the live births in the District of Columbia, for example, are to single, minority mothers under the age of 17, the family as we know it has changed. Many of these children from single-parent homes arrive at school ill-prepared.

Avishai seems unaware of the need for social stability in order to make innovations work. How, one wonders, will advanced methods operate in schools, communities, and families that are in chaos? And for some reason, his solutions concentrate almost exclusively on public education, while private and parochial schools seem to work because of their high social capital, strict rules of conduct, and fundamental stability -- conditions that are prevalent in traditional homes and communities.

School structures resist change. Urban school systems are difficult to change because they are such complex organizations. Pupils and their classes are usually divided by age, grade, ability, needs, subjects, interests, and location -- reflecting the ideology of the very bureaucracies that Avishai predicts are vanishing. But, according to Avishai, the modern corporation is being "flattened," opened up, and made free, resembling a small entrepreneurial organization more than a corporate giant. Mindless work is being performed by "brilliant" computers, freeing humans to do the "zestful" activities associated with new "intelligent enterprises," to use James Brian Quinn's term. However, while new business enterprises are undergoing a revolution, many schools are not, and their structure is greatly to blame for their inability to change.

Public monopolies resist change. Why, one wonders, would public school teachers and administrators even attempt all these radical changes? Adam Smith, of all people, would understand the limits of public monopolies. Without real competition, agencies have no incentive to change procedures, merge and alter roles, and update, much less eliminate, divisions of labor. Visits to school classrooms are informative. One sees teachers still keeping students' attendance and performance data in "roll books," not on networked electronic systems. One finds a few old, often useless computers thrown in a corner, and students sitting and staring at teachers, not processing at computers. Learning is didactic, not interactive. And students continue to work alone instead of in groups around two-way "telecomputers" linked to "spectrum-infinite fiber-networks."

As everyone becomes a lifelong learner, education is indeed critical. But what should business do? It makes little sense, as Adam Smith himself would warn, to have private corporations invest exclusively in public school monopolies.

Instead, business should make a compact, first, to see that public, private, and parochial schools are available for the inner-city poor. Second, businesses should extend the compact to help the education of children, not to bankroll more overhead. Innovations that make schools more "thinking," problem-solving, cooperative organizations for children should be expanded. Third, businesses should concentrate on reforms that improve the structure of individual schools, much as business itself is being reorganized. After all, if public schools themselves are dull, repetitive places, how can education inspire students, much less help business?

Avishai is correct that today's learning organizations must become teaching organizations. With business's help, schools can learn as they teach as well. Otherwise, we are all in trouble.

Bernard Avishai identifies unemployability as the most crippling problem facing the United States. However, he is too quick to define a narrow solution in which businesses assume responsibility both for restructuring schools and for establishing alternative educational opportunities.

It is no secret that companies have become increasingly involved in supporting the improvement and reform of elementary and secondary schools. The Council for Aid to Education has traced this growing corporate interest in public education from near indifference in the early 1960s to a strong investment in the 1990s of time, commitment, and knowledge. But business hasn't invested much money. In fact, by 1992, direct cash contributions from corporations to k-12 education had reached only $360 million out of a total $2.4 billion directed by business toward all educational causes.

Business does not currently have primary responsibility for education in the United States, nor, I would argue, should it. The responsibility for providing young people with the foundation of skills and knowledge they need for careers and work rests with the education system. When Avishai argues that public education be transformed through a network of instructional options offered by business, he is proposing, in effect, that we dismantle an existing powerful and cohesive force in this society. In addition, it is interesting to note that at the same time he proposes we fragment schooling among a kaleidoscope of entrepreneurial activities, he also echoes the call for standards and other measures that require both conformity and accountability.

Restructuring public education by turning it into a for-profit enterprise for business won't work because, most likely, it would be a one-school-at-a-time approach. Business leaders have created schools in several cities like Chicago and Minneapolis; Education Alternatives, Inc., and Public Strategies Group, Inc., have contracted for school management and services in several districts; the New American Schools Development Corporation and the Edison Project provide alternative models of schools. However, against a $248 billion, 84,500 school enterprise, these isolated islands of innovation do not have much hope of producing a redesigned, reformed school system that is able to produce both highly skilled and knowledgeable graduates.

The appropriate role for business in public education is at the same time more limited than Avishai imagines and more powerful. In addition to its support of education programs or its charitable activities, business has a strong platform from which to focus public attention on the education reform agenda and guide a public commitment to reinventing schools, if business were to assume responsibility for delivering education, it would lose its autonomy and weaken its position as an advocate for change.

Instead, business might devote much more of its political clout to the reform agenda by making high-quality education a legislative priority at national, state, and local levels. If it did, business would become a major catalyst to ensure those fundamental changes necessary for long-term school reform: clearly defined learning outcomes for students at key points in their educational careers; high standards for curricula, instruction, and assessment; revised education policies that promote and reward effective teaching and management practices; and the complete redesign of general education and teacher education requirements at the college level.

Bernard Avishai suggests that business's role in education evolve beyond citizenship into teaching. Clearly there is a need. It would be surprising, however, if companies now doing something else for a living went into teaching.

Those companies that do will likely be a new kind of company or an expanded form of media, telephone, and computer companies. They may prefer not to teach in school. School is a political market. Beyond school there is a consumer market. And businesses will be tempted to sell education -- courses, exams, a "certificate of mastery" validated by colleges and employers -- directly to families.

If we want new technologies to reach public education, we will have to rearrange the system so that teachers benefit directly from improvements in student performance and productivity. Some solutions do exist, however. Suppose teachers formed small professional groups and, on contract to school boards, took responsibility for an elementary school or for the math, science, or language department of a high school. The groups would be accountable for student performance, could decide how the job got done, and would be paid a lump sum. Such an arrangement would give teachers the opportunity and incentive to adopt methods, materials, and technologies that would improve student learning and reduce costs in the system. The teacher groups could be a market for those methods, materials, and technologies.

Stimulating and leading this rearrangement of the system would be the logical role for traditional companies to assume. But business does not like to challenge the system. As one unusually thoughtful and civic-minded CEO in Minnesota said to me last spring, "It doesn't make sense for a CEO to get deeply into education. At this stage, you probably don't have kids in school. If you do, you can afford a good education, private or public. To change the system would take more time than you have. You don't feel you can speak with authority about educational issues. Besides, business is harder now and needs your attention."

Business's involvement in education reflects this attitude. The idea is to do some good in some schools and classrooms in ways that will help the company's image (and perhaps its business) without taking on prominent educators in public. Educators understand and exploit this position. They use business's political influence to get taxes raised, and they use business's contributions to finance the facade of activity that protects the system from having to change in unwelcome ways.

Companies not willing to run either the commercial risks of teaching or the political risks of change would help most by withdrawing from the field for a while. Their present efforts are the equivalent of doing your daughter's homework: a misplaced kindness. They hurt rather help a critical institution that is in desperate need of improvement.

Given the new nature of work today, which requires the ability for lifelong learning and continuous change rather than acquiring and being trained in one skill for life, there is hardly any doubt that business does have an obligation to support the reform of public education. The question is where this thinking should lead us. Should the old division of labor be replaced by a new integration of the private and public sectors? What are the criteria for integration? As much as I agree with Avishai, following Marshall and Tucker, I think we need a much broader and deeper understanding of the demarcation lines between the public and private sectors in the field of education.

I like to think of the whole system of education as a gigantic tree with many branches. How are these branches interconnected? How do we make sure that people have choices once they climb the tree? Which parts of the system should be subject to the discipline of competition? How do incentives work in education? Is the educational system like a value-adding chain? Business is already involved in education. Companies run their own universities. They run profit-making schools. And many are involved in one form or another of school-to-work programs. School-to-work programs are most promising because, through them, the public and private sectors can build natural partnerships, like joint ventures in business. And as experience shows, joint ventures work best once the partners are truly complementing each other, each one doing something the other cannot do well.

One kind of school-to-work program is the apprenticeship program, modeled on the European versions. The Siemens Corporation has set up three apprenticeship programs in the United States. Schooling is provided by community colleges (or technical high schools), professional training by companies, and added to the mix are such old-fashioned attitudes and values as discipline, loyalty, and self-respect.

One final point does remain, however: Are we certain about the future availability of work? Indeed, another kind of division of labor suggests itself: between work and nonwork. We might have to educate the workforce of the future with this dichotomy in mind.

My experience of corporations -- in my work trying to find ways to improve the Chicago public schools -- is more schizophrenic than Avishai's picture of businesses being spoken for by single-voiced "masters." I find corporations to be two-tongued mammoths in the arena of governmental policy making. In Chicago, I frequently met and worked with community-affairs officers, who spoke of the social obligations of their companies. However, when I went to the state capitol, I had to deal with the tax and workers' compensation lobbyists, who focused on saving their companies' tax and benefit dollars. For the policy advocate, the problem is to persuade the "master" to listen to his community-affairs tongue rather than his tax-lobbyist tongue.

We were successful in getting Chicago business "masters" personally involved in reforming the Chicago public schools, first through the mayor's education summit and then through an unprecedented lobbying blitz of corporation presidents. Without their support, there would not be a Chicago School Reform Act, devolving authority to individual schools through school-based management. But our success in reform legislation was not repeated when we attempted to amend the Illinois constitution to assert that education is a fundamental right of all children. Then the tax-lobbyist voices rose up and fought us down, outspending the advocates for an adequately funded school system by four to one.

Avishai misses an important phenomenon in business action in the policy arena. Businesses do not act individually to affect governmental policy; they act "corporately" through associations. In the policy arena, we rarely deal with the "masters" but with the Illinois Chamber of Commerce and the Illinois Manufacturer's Association. The boards of these state associations are full of the tax-lobbyist types. In order to negotiate successfully with this one-sided representation of the business community, we policy advocates must learn to be more successful in appealing to the narrow self-interest of business that Avishai highlights in Adam Smith.

The traditional loci of authority in public schooling in the United States have been the state and the school district. Today authority is moving both up and down the chain of government. The federal government is currently assuming directorial control of public education: articulating goals, propounding standards, helping establish national teacher certification levels, and mandating expanded national assessments of student achievement. At the same time, individual schools are gaining greater flexibility to determine how they will meet the new, higher national standards. States and school districts are, in turn, losing authority.

But the Department of Education continues to act only through states. This is not surprising. U.S. presidents since 1976 have primarily been former governors, and the department is headed by two former governors. But for those concerned with the problems of the civitas, and particularly urban schools, a state focus is counterproductive. State legislators regularly speak of the "black hole" of city schools. In Illinois, there is one school code for Chicago and another set of laws for the rest of the state. The general superintendent in Chicago makes $175,000 a year, while the state superintendent in Chicago makes $60,000! Is it any wonder that state education policy focuses on the 939 non-Chicago school districts (average size, 1,350 students) while it ignores Chicago's 411,000 students?

Avishai is quite correct that new manufacturing processes are calling into question the current organization and sponsoring of public schooling. I would simply add that it must call into question and radically change the operations of the "sovereign" as well.

Business can improve education if it stops throwing money at public schools and insists on their complete restructuring.

Corporate support of education represents 40% of total corporate charitable contributions, or $2.4 billion. Between 1961 and 1990, corporate aid to education in the United States increased by 298.5% from $804 million to $2.4 billion in constant 1990 dollars. Corporations with charitable programs of less than $500,000 earmarked an average of 28% of their contributions for education, while companies with programs of more than $5 million similarly earmarked an average of 39% of their contributions.

These contributions have made little difference. In a 1991 survey of employers, educators, and parents sponsored by the Committee for Economic Development, only 12% of employers felt that high school graduates could write well, and only 22% said that these same students had a decent mastery of math. In addition, the National Alliance of Business estimates that by 1995, 14 million U.S. citizens will not be prepared for the jobs available.

Business has incurred great expense to remedy the inadequacies of public education. For example, Motorola, Inc., screens up to 15 job applicants for every employee it hires and is looking for only seventh grade reading and ninth grade math skills. After it completes this hiring process, Motorola must then spend an average of $250 per employee to train U.S. workers in quality control techniques, while its Japanese competitor spends only 50 cents to prepare the average employee. Similarly, IBM spends approximately 17% of its $60 billion in total revenues each year on education and training, including funds for 7,000 teachers' salaries, classrooms, and textbooks.

The public school bureaucracy constantly tells business that the key to a better prepared workforce is to spend increasingly more money on education. However, consider the current funding levels:

Federal funding for education in 1992 totaled $61.4 billion, having risen by 30% between 1985 and 1992. State governments spent a total of $196 billion on education in 1991, accounting for more than one-third of their $554.6 billion in general expenditures. The 1991 state total for education expenditures was 10% higher than spending in 1990. In 1976, per pupil expenditures in public schools averaged $3,127 in constant 1990 dollars. By 1990, this figure had climbed to $5,264 -- an increase of 68%. However, despite these significant increases in spending, SAT scores fell from an average of 943 in 1970 to 900 by 1990, and ACT scores dropped from 19.9 in 1970 to 18.6 in 1989.

Business leaders must apply the lessons of the marketplace to education reform: competition breeds quality; investment without productivity is wasteful; and producers must be accountable to consumers. These principles suggest that markets, rather than bureaucratic monopolies, should deliver the service of education to U.S. students. The federal, state, and local governments must be forced to realize that their job is to educate all children, not to bend to the whims of a bureaucracy of special interests and prop up failing schools.

Government schools have proved that they cannot teach corporate America's future employees the skills necessary to prosper in the workplace. Students should now be allowed to use the money that government allocates for their education in order to choose a school that will provide them with the necessary training.

In fact, U.S. business leaders are already applying market principles to education. There are many examples of their activity. They have set up private school scholarship funds in numerous cities around the country. These privately financed scholarships give poor children a chance to leave dangerous and ineffective public schools and choose a private school that provides a quality education and better suits their individual needs. In addition, companies like Champion International, as well as business groups in several cities, are using their management expertise to design market-based reforms for school districts.

U.S. schools must be completely restructured, and business has the power and ability to push for the necessary changes.
